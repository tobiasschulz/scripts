# https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/34641

# This issue is due to some efi variable storage checks in kernel >=3.8 (to prevent Samsung UEFI like issues)
# and due to the inclusion of support for storing pstore dumps in efi variable storage.
# Without "efi_no_storage_paranoia" the kernel will refuse to write/modify any efivar if the firmware reports
# that more than half of its total efivar storage space is already used up.
# The parameter "efi_no_storage_paranoia" disables this check.

# Check for existence of /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/dump-* files. If they exist delete them
# (ie. pstore dumps stored in efivars) and reboot. You should be able to use efibootmgr properly without
# "efi_no_storage_paranoia".
